Problem :: 
3168. Minimum Number of Chairs in a Waiting Room
You are given a string s. Simulate events at each second i:
If s[i] == 'E', a person enters the waiting room and takes one of the chairs in it.
If s[i] == 'L', a person leaves the waiting room, freeing up a chair.
Return the minimum number of chairs needed so that a chair is available for every person who enters the waiting room given that it is initially empty.

Time Complexity ::  O(n)
Space Complexity ::  O(1)

Code :: 
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumChairs(string s) {
        int cnt=0;
        int maxi = 0;
        for(int i=0 ; i<s.size() ; i++){
            if(s[i]=='E')cnt++;
            else cnt--;
            maxi = max(maxi , cnt);
        }
        return maxi;
    }
};
